```sql

-- Active Appointments
SELECT p.name AS patient, d.name AS doctor, a.appointment_date
FROM Appointments a
JOIN Patients p ON a.patient_id = p.patient_id
JOIN Doctors d ON a.doctor_id = d.doctor_id
WHERE a.status = 'Scheduled';

-- Medicine Stock Alert
SELECT name, quantity FROM Medicines WHERE quantity < 100;

-- Current Hospitalized Patients
SELECT p.name, r.room_number
FROM Room_Allocations r
JOIN Patients p ON r.patient_id = p.patient_id
WHERE r.discharge_date IS NULL;

-- Patient Billing Summary with Department Filter
SELECT 
    p.name AS patient_name,
    d.department_name,
    COUNT(a.appointment_id) AS visits,
    SUM(b.amount) AS total_billed
FROM Patients p
JOIN Appointments a ON p.patient_id = a.patient_id
JOIN Doctors doc ON a.doctor_id = doc.doctor_id
JOIN Departments d ON doc.department_id = d.department_id
LEFT JOIN Bills b ON p.patient_id = b.patient_id
WHERE d.department_name = 'Cardiology'  -- Filter by department
GROUP BY p.patient_id, d.department_name
HAVING total_billed > 1000;  -- Only show significant bills

-- Doctor Availability Check
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE CheckDoctorAvailability(
    IN p_doctor_id INT,
    IN p_appointment_date DATETIME,
    OUT p_is_available BOOLEAN
)
BEGIN
    DECLARE conflict_count INT;
    
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO conflict_count
    FROM Appointments
    WHERE doctor_id = p_doctor_id
    AND appointment_date = p_appointment_date
    AND status != 'Cancelled';
    
    SET p_is_available = (conflict_count = 0);
END //
DELIMITER ;

-- Usage:
CALL CheckDoctorAvailability(101, '2025-07-15 10:00:00', @is_available);
SELECT @is_available AS is_doctor_available;
